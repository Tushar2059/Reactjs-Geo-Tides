          <p>
            To verify the algebraic identity (a - b)<sup>2</sup>= a<sup>2</sup>-

          <h6>Algebraic Identity</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>
              An Algebraic identity is an equality, which is true for all values
              of the variables in the equality.
            </li>
            <li>
              The algebraic equations which are valid for all values of
              variables in them are called algebraic identities.
            </li>
            <li>
              In this way, algebraic identities are used in the computation of
              algebraic expressions and solving different polynomials
            </li>
            <li>
              Algebraic identities are also used for the factorization of
              polynomials.

          <h6>Square</h6>
          <p>
            A square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four
            equal sides and four equal angles of 90 degrees each.

          <p>Area of a Square</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The product of the length of each side itself.</li>
            <li> Formula : Area = sideÂ²</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Rectangle</h6>
          <p>
            rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles and opposite
            sides are equal. The length of a rectangle is the size of the longer
            side, whereas the breadth is the size of the shorter side

          <p>Area of a Rectangle</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The product of its length and breadth</li>
